        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hi, I am a tech enthusiast and aspiring software engineer with a passion for solving problems and building efficient systems. I specialize in networking, DevOps, and cybersecurity, with hands-on experience in containerized environments and homelab setups. When I am not coding or optimizing workflows, I enjoy exploring minimalist game design and experimenting with the real world application of my code using hardware like the Raspberry Pi.

            Currently, I am focused on creating user-friendly projects that showcase my technical expertise and creativity.</p>
